## MRI Reconstruction Using Compressive Sensing

## Overview

This project demonstrates MRI image reconstruction using compressive sensing techniques. Compressive sensing enables the reconstruction of high-quality images from under-sampled k-space data, reducing scan time while maintaining image fidelity.

## Features

Reconstruction of MRI images from sparse k-space data.

Implementation of compressive sensing using optimization techniques.

Comparison of original and reconstructed MRI images.
